Click on the banner to be taken to the landing page of the application, which should look like the one below:

And you're in! 

## Troubleshooting
1. *Sometimes theres a `Downloaded with 100%` bar below the screen that doesn't go away on the Plantbuds Landing screen. Is this a bug?*
No, this is just Expo's Tunnel downloading the dependencies onto your phone. If the bar does not go away, just shake your phone and this screen should appear:

Just press refresh and the app will reload, removing the download bar on the bottom once it is done. 

2. *I noticed that when I do actions in quick succession, such as pressing delete a plant and then pressing on the deleted plant, the homepage shows a blank plant*
