# Quickstart Instruction
## Installation 
```

```

## Running the Application
```
$ npm start

Expo should then open a tab in your default browser as shown below:

Make sure to switch the connection to "Tunnel" before you scan the QR Code. Expo should then open on your device once you scan the Tunnel QR Code :)

## Seeing your changes in code in Expo 
Sometimes if you save/update a file (eg: Updating styling of a button), it does not show automatically in Expo. In that case, shake your phone until the Dev Menu pictured below pops up from the bottom of the screen:

Pressing "Refresh" will then refresh the app to reflect the changes you made in code. 

## Inspecting elements in Expo 
In the Dev Menu pressing on "Show Element Inspector" will allow you to inspect your elements much like how you would inspect elements of a webpage.
